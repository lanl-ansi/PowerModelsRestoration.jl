A PowerModelsRestoration provides extensions to [PowerModels](https://github.com/lanl-ansi/PowerModels.jl) for solving the power system restoration tasks.  A core building block in PowerModelsRestoration is the Maximum Load Delivery (MLD) problem, which provides a reliable numerical method for solving challenging N-k damage scenarios, such as those that arise in the analysis of extreme events.

## Core Problem Specifications

* Restoration Ordering Problem (rop)
* Minimum Restoration Set Problem (mrsp)
* Forward Restoration Redispatch
* Maximum Load Delivery with Discrete Variables (mld_uc)
* Maximum Load Delivery with Continuous Variables (mld)

## Core Network Formulations

* AC (polar coordinates)
* DC Approximation (polar coordinates)
* SOC Relaxation (W-space)
* SDP Relaxation (W-space)
